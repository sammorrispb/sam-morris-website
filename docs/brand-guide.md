## Brand Voice Guide

### Tone
- **Friendly yet direct** — like talking to a coach you trust
- **Empathetic and action-oriented** — you understand the parent's world
- **Strategic but human** — smart without being cold
- **Up-tempo and encouraging** — coach energy, not corporate energy

### Writing Rules

**Do:**
- Be clear, specific, and real
- Use short sentences and bullet points
- Give actionable next steps
- Share personal stories and lessons
- Speak like a coach, not a marketer

**Don't:**
- Use buzzwords without substance
- Write long, complex paragraphs
- Be vague or inspirational-only
- Be too technical or rigid
- Use generic phrases like "unlock your potential"

### Sample Voice

**For parents:**
> *"Know your child's focus this week and what to practice at home in under 5 minutes."*

**For kids:**
> *"Level up one skill each week. Collect your EASE badge."*

**Social media bio:**
> *Coach. Dad. Builder. Director of Programming at Dill Dinkers. Co-founder of Next Gen Academy. Real talk about coaching, parenting, and sport.*
