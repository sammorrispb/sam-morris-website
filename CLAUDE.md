- TypeScript strict mode
- Server Components by default, `"use client"` only when needed
- JSON-LD structured data on program pages for rich snippets
- ESLint via `eslint-config-next`

```
npm run dev    # Start dev server
npm run build  # Production build
npm run lint   # ESLint
```

## Notes for Claude Code
- This is Sam's personal site. He is building technical skills while developing it.
- Prefer simple, readable code. Explain non-obvious decisions.
- Always consider mobile responsiveness.
- When updating /locations or DD-branded content, reference the Dill Dinkers Brand Guidelines PDF.
- Stripe Payment Links are external — no server-side Stripe processing needed.
