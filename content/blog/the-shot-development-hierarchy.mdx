Most players chase spin before they can place the ball. Here's the order that actually works — and why getting it right changes everything about your game.

## Placement First

Before anything else, you need to be able to put the ball where you want it. Consistently. Under pressure. This is the foundation everything else builds on.

Think of it this way: a perfectly placed ball at moderate speed is more effective than a rocket that goes where your opponent wants it. Placement is the skill that separates intermediate players from advanced ones.

## Speed Second

Once you can place the ball, you earn the right to add pace. Speed without placement is just giving your opponent a faster ball to work with.

The key insight: speed amplifies placement. A well-placed ball with pace gives your opponent less time to react. But pace alone? That's just hitting hard and hoping.

## Spin Last

Spin is the finishing touch. It makes good shots great. But it only works when placement and speed are already dialed in.

Here's the truth most players don't want to hear: you can have an elite game without fancy spin. You cannot have an elite game without placement.

The hierarchy is simple. Following it is the hard part.
