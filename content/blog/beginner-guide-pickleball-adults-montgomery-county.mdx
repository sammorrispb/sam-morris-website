Thinking about trying pickleball? You're not alone. Montgomery County, MD has become one of the hottest pickleball markets in the country, with new courts opening, indoor facilities expanding, and a community that genuinely welcomes beginners.

Here's everything you need to know to get started.

## Why Adults Love Pickleball

Pickleball isn't just a trend — it's a lifestyle shift for thousands of adults in Montgomery County. Here's why:

- **Low impact, high cardio** — easier on joints than tennis or basketball, but still a serious workout
- **Social by design** — doubles play means you're always meeting people
- **Quick to learn** — most adults are rallying within their first session
- **Addictively competitive** — the skill ceiling is high enough to keep you challenged for years
- **All ages play together** — one of the few sports where a 30-year-old and a 65-year-old can have a competitive match

## Where to Play Pickleball in Montgomery County

### Indoor Courts (Year-Round)

## What Equipment Do You Need?

Good news — you need very little to start:

- **Paddle** — Borrow one at open play sessions or buy a beginner-friendly paddle ($30–$80 range)
- **Balls** — Provided at all facilities and open play sessions
- **Court shoes** — Any athletic shoe with lateral support works (avoid running shoes)
- **Comfortable athletic wear** — That's it

Don't invest in expensive equipment until you know what style of play you prefer. A coach can help you choose the right paddle for your game once you've developed some fundamentals.

## The Fastest Way to Improve

Drop-in play is fun, but it's not the fastest way to get better. Here's the progression that works:

### 1. Get a Skill Evaluation

Before anything else, understand where you are. A 30-minute skill evaluation with a certified coach gives you a baseline DUPR rating and identifies exactly what to work on first. At Dill Dinkers Rockville and North Bethesda, evaluations are free for members.

### 2. Take a Few Private Lessons

Even 2-3 private lessons can accelerate your development by months compared to self-teaching. A good coach will fix mechanical issues early — before they become habits — and give you a structured practice plan.

### 3. Play Organized Games

Once you have fundamentals, join organized play at your skill level. Playing against opponents who are slightly better than you is the sweet spot for growth.

### 4. Track Your Progress

Use the DUPR rating system to measure improvement over time. The [Link & Dink](https://www.linkanddink.com) community app connects Montgomery County players of comparable skill levels, so your matches are always competitive and fun.

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

After coaching hundreds of adult beginners in Montgomery County, here are the patterns I see most often:

1. **Hitting too hard** — Placement beats power every time at the beginner level
2. **Ignoring the kitchen** — The non-volley zone is where points are won and lost
3. **Playing only with friends** — You improve fastest playing against different styles
4. **Skipping fundamentals** — Grip, ready position, and footwork matter more than any trick shot
5. **Not warming up** — Pickleball is athletic. Treat your body accordingly.

## Ready to Start?
