Every facility offers courts. Every app offers features. But community? That's the thing competitors can't copy.

## The Lesson

When I started building programs at Dill Dinkers, the courts were the draw. But what kept people coming back was each other. The regulars. The friendly rivalries. The post-game conversations in the parking lot.

You can build the best facility in the world. Without community, it's just a building with good lighting.

## Building the Moat

Community doesn't happen by accident. It takes intentional design — the right mix of competitive and social, structured and freeform. You create the conditions and let people do the rest.

A few things I've learned:
- **Mix skill levels** in social play. Advanced players mentoring beginners creates bonds.
- **Create rituals**. Weekly round-robins, monthly tournaments, seasonal celebrations.
- **Name things**. When people feel like they belong to something with a name, they show up more.
- **Celebrate milestones**. First tournament, first win, first year playing — make it matter.

That's what Link & Dink is built on. Not features. People.
